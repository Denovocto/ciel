The Ciel programming language keeps programming clean, simple and fun.

# Introduction
The Ciel programming language is a statically typed, generic and structured programming language. The general idea of the language is for it to be fun and simple to program in while still exploring fresh and new concepts. 

The main purpose of this Ciel programming language is to remove all unnecessary complexity and maximize developer efficiency. The language also helps to produce clean and consistent applications which can be easily read and understood, making usability one of it strongest features. Ciel programming language is written using C and C++ as its base.

# Motivation
The main motivation behind the Ciel programming language is to explore interesting ideas and introduce them to the programming community in a fresh and simple manner such that it will prove to be fun and intuitive to work on. This is the reason why the Ciel team decided to create a language in which its syntax will be more clear and precise, because it will bring another interesting way of interacting and interfacing with a computer system in a much personalized or stylish way. Therefore, Ciel will bring a more comfortable and orderly feel to its users.

# Technologies 
* C and C++ programming languages
* Lex/Flex as a scanner generator in C
* Yacc/Bison as a parser generator in C++

# Compiling
To use Ciel, you can run it locally by using the makefile and then executing the executable file:
```
make
./ciel_scanner
```
This will let you use Ciel as a type of interpreted language.

If you want to compile and run a file written in Ciel language, you will run it as we previously did but adding the file's name next to the exe file as following:
```
make
./ciel_scanner example.ci
```

# Example Code
You can check out an example of a simple Hello World program written in Ciel language here:
