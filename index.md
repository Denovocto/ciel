## Welcome to The Ciel Programming Language 

### Introduction to Ciel
In this video you will see a brief description of how Ciel programming actually is: [![Ciel Programming Language Intro](https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1620958775/video_to_markdown/images/google-drive--1IMh1DS_GApzZde7JgttBbk6XzMplrxGZ-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IMh1DS_GApzZde7JgttBbk6XzMplrxGZ/view?usp=sharing "Ciel Programming Language Intro")



### Motivation
The main motivation behind the Ciel programming language is to explore interesting ideas and introduce them to the programming community in a fresh and simple manner such that it will prove to be pleasant and intuitive to work on. This is the reason why the Ciel team decided to create a language in which its syntax will be more clear and precise, because it will bring another interesting way of interacting and interfacing with a computer system in a much personalized or stylish way. Therefore, Ciel brings a more comfortable and orderly feel to its users.

### Language Features
* Statically Typed
* Structured Language
* Imperative Language
* Reads/Writes Stdin/Stdout
* Unlimited Variable Declarations
* Different Variable Typed like: int, float, string, bool and char
* Operations Between Types
* Contextual Stack



### Approach
The Ciel programming language was designed with usability and readability in mind, without making compromise in performance. The ciel scanner is written in C using the C99 standard, whilst the Ciel Parser is written in C++ using the C++11 standard. The scanner generator used was Lex/Flex, while the parser generator used was Yacc/Bison. Additionally, we used the Makebuild system.
